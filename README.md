## Operational Relevance

This project demonstrates foundational network administration supporting endpoint connectivity and identity services in a simulated small-office environment. An IP addressing plan is included for a single IPv4 subnet along with a lightweight asset register documenting core devices. DHCP and basic DNS services are configured to provide consistent address assignment and name resolution for networked endpoints, supporting reliable service discovery and domain authentication. The current scope is intentionally limited to networking fundamentals and designed to complement identity and directory services documented in a separate Active Directory project.

## Job Skills (IT Operations)

- Configure and support network infrastructure to provide reliable endpoint connectivity  
- Document IPv4 addressing using a defined subnet, DHCP scope, and gateway configuration  
- Configure and validate DHCP and basic DNS services  
- Maintain an asset register to track devices, roles, hostnames, and network context  

## Future Enhancements

- Introduce a virtualized lab server to demonstrate server hosting concepts and support additional infrastructure services  
- Implement a VPN solution to enable secure remote access and simulate off-site connectivity scenarios  
- Add network monitoring or health checks to increase visibility into device availability and performance (PowerShell)
